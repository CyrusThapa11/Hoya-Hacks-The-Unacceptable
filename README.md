# APPNAME

## 💡 Inspiration

The covid pandemic is still present. All category of people are severly affected by it.Doctors and healthcare workers are working day and night for the people , we as developers decided to make the lives easier for students and came up with the idea of building a web app which makes their learning easier.

## 💻 What it does

This web app helps students to visualize different topics of their curricullum which are difficult to learn or visualize , inturn making it easy for students to learn and gain practical knowledge of its working.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Node Js: For backend
- Coil: For web monetization
- Firebase: For database and user authentication
- Three.js: For 3D rendering and animation

## 💲 Best Web Monetization Project

We also use Coil to create micropayments to the user you wish, to support them and hence motivate them to keep helping the community. Coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website with a small fee.

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Firebase is a cloud service that provides real-time, high-performance, and easy-to-use cloud database and authentication. Firebase is a free service and easy to use. It helps you build a cloud-based application that is easy to use, scalable, and reliable.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com

Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech. We will choose the best domain name among all.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Finding public 3D models were difficult . So had to explore different platforms.
- 3D models are heavy so the app's performance is not that great .

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Able to complete the project within timeline

## 📖 What we learned

- Time management
- Collaborate with people
- Got hands on with 3D modeling
-

## 🚀 What's next for APPNAME

- Adding morefunctionality
- Optimizing its performance
